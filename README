# 🖼️ Image Processing GUI

This project is a simple yet powerful **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for basic image processing operations. It allows users to perform functions such as converting RGB images to grayscale, displaying histograms, generating image complements, and more — all with just a few clicks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload and display any image
- 🎨 Convert RGB to **Grayscale**
- 📊 Display **Histogram** of the image
- 🌓 Generate **Complement** (negative) of the image
- 🔄 **Reset** to original image

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MATLAB** (GUI created using GUIDE or App Designer)
- Image Processing Toolbox

---

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `.fig` and `.m` file (if using GUIDE), or `.mlapp` file (if using App Designer).
4. Click **Run** to launch the GUI.

## 🧪 How to Use the GUI

1. Click the **Upload Image** button to select and load an image.
2. Use any of the available buttons to:
   - Convert to **Grayscale**
   - Show **Histogram**
   - View **Image Complement**
3. Use the **Reset** button to go back to the original image.
