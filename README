# GUI for Image Processing Operations

Overview:

This project provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for performing various image processing operations. Built in MATLAB, the GUI enables users to easily upload, process, and analyze images with a wide range of functionalities, making it useful for both learning and research purposes.

Features:

1. Image Upload & Reset: Load and reset images within the GUI.
2. Transformations: Grayscale, HSV conversion, brightness adjustment, flipping, rotating.
3. Noise Processing: Add and remove Gaussian/Poisson noise, noise averaging.
4. Analysis Tools: Histogram generation, PDF estimation, autocorrelation, power spectral density (PSD).
5. Statistical Operations: Central moments, RGB channel covariance, function transformation g(x)=log(1+x).
6. Visualization: Results and processed outputs are displayed clearly in aligned plots within the GUI.

Methodology:

1. Input: User uploads an image via the GUI.
2. Operation Selection: Desired image processing functions are selected through buttons or dropdown menus.
3. Processing: MATLAB executes the selected operation on the image.
4. Output: Processed image, analysis plots, or calculated results are displayed in the GUI window.

Applications:

1. Educational use for understanding image processing concepts.
2. Research and experimentation on noise models and transformations.
3. Hands-on practice with statistical and frequency-domain image analysis.

Example Operations:

1 Converting a color image to grayscale.
2. Adding Gaussian noise and visualizing its effect using PSD.
3. Computing central moments of an image for feature extraction.
